 *
 * @brief Introduces the fundamentals of concurrency by creating and running
 *        multiple threads of execution.
 *
 *        ---
 *
 *        ## Doing Multiple Things at Once: Concurrency
 *
 *        All the programs we've written so far have been **single-threaded**.
 *        They follow one path of
 *        execution from top to bottom, doing one thing at a time.
 *        **Concurrency** is the ability of
 *        a program to handle multiple tasks at the same time. This is achieved
 *        through **multithreading**.
 *
 *        A **thread** is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that
 *        can be managed independently
 *        by an operating system scheduler. Think of it like having multiple
 *        chefs in a kitchen instead of
 *        just one; the kitchen can produce more food faster because multiple
 *        tasks (chopping, sautÃ©ing, plating)
 *        are happening in parallel. [1, 2, 4]
 *
 *        In Java, you can make your programs multithreaded to perform
 *        long-running tasks in the background
 *        (like a network download) without freezing the main application, or to
 *        take advantage of
 *        modern multi-core processors to speed up intensive computations.
 *
 *        ### What you will learn:
 *        - The concept of a `Thread` and its lifecycle.
 *        - The two primary ways to define a task for a thread: extending
 *        `Thread` and implementing `Runnable`. [5]
 *        - The critical difference between calling `thread.start()` and
 *        `thread.run()`.
 *        - How to use `Thread.sleep()` to pause a thread's execution.
 *        - How to use `thread.join()` to wait for a thread to finish.
 *        - A preview of the dangers of multithreading: race conditions.

        // --- METHOD 1: Extending the Thread class ---
        // This is simple, but less flexible, as Java does not support multiple
        // inheritance.

        // It returns immediately, allowing the main thread to continue. [7]
        thread1.start();

        // --- METHOD 2: Implementing the Runnable interface ---
        // This is the PREFERRED approach. It separates the task (`Runnable`) from the
        // execution mechanism (`Thread`), which is better design. Your task class can
        // still extend another class. [5, 8]

        TaskByImplementingRunnable myTask = new TaskByImplementingRunnable();
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(myTask);
        thread2.start();

        // --- METHOD 3: The Modern Way with Lambdas ---
        // Since `Runnable` is a functional interface (it has only one abstract method,
        // `run()`),
        // we can use a concise lambda expression. This is very common.

        // **IMPORTANT:** Never call `run()` directly (e.g., `thread1.run()`).
        // This would NOT start a new thread. It would simply execute the `run()` method
        // on the current (main) thread, just like any other normal method call.

        // --- Waiting for Threads to Finish with `join()` ---
        // `thread.join()` makes the current thread (in this case, `main`) block and
        // wait
        // until the thread it's called on has completed its execution. [9]
        // This is essential for coordinating tasks.

        t_inc2.join();

        // The expected result is 20,000. However, the actual result will likely be
        // LESS.
        // This is because the `count++` operation is not atomic. One thread can read
        // the value
        // while the other is in the middle of writing it, causing some increments to be
        // lost.
