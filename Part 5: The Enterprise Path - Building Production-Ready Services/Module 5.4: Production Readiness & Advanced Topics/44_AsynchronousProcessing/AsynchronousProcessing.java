/**
 * This lesson introduces **Asynchronous Processing** in Spring Boot, a powerful
 * technique for improving application responsiveness and throughput.
 *
 * ## The Problem: Long-Running Tasks Block the API
 *
 * By default, web requests in Spring are handled synchronously. When a request comes in,
 * it is processed on a single thread. If that process involves a slow task (like sending an
 * email, generating a complex report, or calling a slow third-party API), the thread is
 * blocked, and the client has to wait until the entire task is finished. This can lead to
 * slow response times and poor user experience.
 *
 * ## The Solution: `@Async`
 *
 * Spring's `@Async` annotation provides a simple yet powerful way to execute a method
 * on a separate thread from the main request-handling thread.
 *
 * The new flow becomes:
 * 1. An HTTP request arrives at the controller.
 * 2. The controller immediately calls a method annotated with `@Async`.
 * 3. The `@Async` method starts running in a background thread from a managed thread pool.
 * 4. The controller method **does not wait** for the background task to finish. It returns
 *    a response to the client immediately (e.g., "Your report is being generated").
 *
 * ## Core Concepts & Annotations Covered:
 *
 * - **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Execution**: Understanding the difference.
 * - **`@EnableAsync`**: The main switch to enable asynchronous processing support in your
 *   Spring Boot application.
 * - **`@Async`**: A method-level annotation that tells Spring to execute the method in a
 *   background thread.
 * - **Thread Pools**: Spring manages a pool of threads to execute these async tasks efficiently.
 *
 * ## PREQUISITES: A `pom.xml` with `spring-boot-starter-web`.
 *
 * ## HOW TO RUN AND TEST THIS API:
 * 1.  Run the `main` method.
 * 2.  Use `curl` to call the API endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/reports`
 * 3.  **Observe the timing**:
 *     - The `curl` command will return an `HTTP 202 Accepted` response **almost instantly**.
 *     - **Watch the application console logs**. You will see the "Report generation started..."
 *       message appear *after* the curl command has already finished. This proves the task
 *       is running in the background.
