 * @brief Project: Use the functional Streams API to perform complex data analysis on a collection.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## From Loops to Pipelines: The Streams API
 *
 * The **Streams API**, introduced in Java 8, provides a powerful, declarative way to process
 * sequences of elements. A stream is not a data structure itself; instead, it's a view or
 * a "conveyor belt" for data from a source (like a `List` or `Array`) that allows you to
 * chain operations together into a pipeline. [2, 3]
 *
 * This approach lets you move from an **imperative** style ("how" to do something, e.g., using
 * `for` loops and `if` statements) to a **declarative** style ("what" you want to achieve).
 * The result is often more concise, readable, and easier to parallelize.
 *
 * ### The Stream Pipeline Structure
 * A stream pipeline consists of three parts:
 * 1.  **Source:** Where the stream comes from (e.g., `myList.stream()`).
 * 2.  **Intermediate Operations (0 or more):** These transform the stream into another stream.
 *     Examples include `filter()`, `map()`, and `sorted()`. These operations are **lazy**â€”they
 *     don't execute until a terminal operation is called. [4, 7]
 * 3.  **Terminal Operation (1):** This produces a final result or a side effect, kicking off
 *     the actual processing of the stream. Examples include `collect()`, `forEach()`, and `count()`. [4, 7]
 *
 * ### What you will learn:
 * - How to create a stream from a collection.
 * - Key intermediate operations: `filter`, `map`, and `sorted`.
 * - Key terminal operations: `collect`, `forEach`, and numeric summaries.
 * - How to chain these operations into a clean, readable data processing pipeline.
